# Sweet-Movie-Search-App

Welcome to my movie search app!

To set up:
1.) Fork and clone this repository to a local directory.
2.) Run "npm install" in the command line within this directory to install the dependency modules.
3.) Run "mongod" to run the database, and "nodemon server" to run the server locally.
4.) The app should now be available at localhost:3000 within your browser.

For this challenge I decided I really wanted to teach myself how to use Backbone since I took the back-end course, and how to integrate it into Node with an Express server and MongoDB as the database. I was able to achieve this, and loved the extra organization that this gave me with my front-end code, but this project also really showed me how the modular nature of Backbone can be more difficult to organize for students who are new to it.

As a future goal for this code, I'd like to look more into further modularizing the code into separate files, as I get more familiar with typical Backbone file structures.

I fought a long hard struggle trying to deploy to Heroku! But I'm just not sure yet how to integrate MongoDB with their system.

I look forward to your feedback!
